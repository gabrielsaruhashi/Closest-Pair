pre-processing step
1) sort pls by x (get half of the points to the left, half of the points to the right)
2) sort by y ()

divide-and-conquer w/ 2 sorte lists'


// sort by x
// sort by y

// get the smallest of left and right, and create a range within the -smallest, + smallest; 
// do a version of brute force in this middle strip


// make strip has 
what if all points are in the middle strip?
	call another makeStrip
