9/18  5:30pm   4:30  Finished greedy and half of backward

9/20  4:30pm   3:00  Finished backward and skip, formatted the PSET, and removed repeated code

9/22  9:30pm   4:00  Finished working implementation for -opt, but it stops working at n > 24

9/24  1:00pm   2:00  Added the required printf statements for argument errors; create safety checks for the arguments to defend myself against bad inputs

9/25  6:30pm   2:30  Reworked code that verified the command line arguments to treat all the possible cases (I could think of) that could break the code

I discussed my solution with: Sarim Abbas.

Learning how to work with pointers was very challenging at first. Opt was definitely the most time-consuming method. I had to do a lot of reading on backtracking to fully understand the reasoning/strategy behind the algorithm. It also took me a lot of time to conceptualize the requirements of the recursive call and think of the base case, though it turned out that the recursive call is rather simple. I had to draw it down on the paper several times to visualize the different layers that the recursion would reach. 
After discussing with Dr. Glenn my solution, I had to start from scratch in order to implement a more efficient version of -opt that would not lead to heap overflows.
