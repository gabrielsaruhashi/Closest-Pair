I discussed my solution with: Sarim Abbas.

Breaking down the problem and thinking about all the edge cases was very challenging at first. First, because I was not very familiar with C, which made it hard to think of possible approaches to tackle the program. Second, I did not really plan and sketch out my solution before starting to code, which forced me to redo my work whenever I remembered of a detail or specification that I had forgotten to consider. My lack of attention made me lose about 5 hours working on the wrong solution with pointers. I would not say, though, that it was a waste of time because I was able to learn a lot about memory allocation, arrays, and string handling in C. After Dr Glenn introduced the concept of Finite State Machines, it was easier to break down all th cases, but I still had a lot of difficulty to address all the particularities of the PSET. Moreover, as I was using While loops with breaks, it was sometimes hard to keep track of everything that was going on.



//TODO
- for opt, skip to next recursive call if range - prospectiveopt < optSize - partialSize; 
- check for skip arguments
- why are sequences starting at 1
