I discussed my solution with: Petey Salovey, Biddy Martin, and Biff Linnane
(and watched four episodes of Futurama).

Debugging the graph construction was difficult because the size of the
graph made it impossible to check by hand.  Using asserts helped
tremendously, as did counting the incoming and outgoing edges for
each vertex.  The other major problem was my use of two different variables
in the same function called _score and score.  The last bug ended up being
using one in place of the other; I now realize the danger of having two
variables with names varying only in punctuation -- since they both sound
the same when reading the code back in my head it was not obvious when
I was using the wrong one.
